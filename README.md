# DiscordTestBot
A test bot that I'm using to learn about how to work with the Discord4J API. I'll likely use this to test commands that will be implemented in other projects
Doesn't really do too much right now. It has a clean command (removes all messages in a channel), a coin flip command, and a basic ping command.
